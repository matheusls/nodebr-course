## NodeBR Course

This is repository for code developed during [NodeBR's](https://erickwendel.teachable.com/p/node-js-para-iniciantes-nodebr) beginner course.

Because I'm working alone in this, I'm using a `git rebase` based git flow, so you probably won't see any other branch or pull requests here.
