#### #02 CLASS

This class' subject was the **_asynchronous_** nature of Javascript and how to work with **_callbacks_**, **_Promises_** and **_async/await_**.

First, we learned about **_Event Loop_** and asynchronous tasks, how it affects the execution of our code and how to work with it using **_callbacks_** only.

Then we learned about **_callback hell_** and how to make our code more clean and readable using **_Promises_** to handle asynchronous tasks.

Finally, we learned about **_Promise hell_** and the **_async/await_** syntax, how to use it to handle our asynchronous tasks and when we should use it, so it doesn't affects performance.
